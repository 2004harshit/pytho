# let us work on a simple problem and visualize the need of loop
# Write a program to print a table of a number

n=int(input("Enter the number whose table u want to print"))
print(n*1)
print(n*2)
print(n*3)
print(n*4)
print(n*5)
print(n*6)
print(n*7)
print(n*8)
print(n*9)
print(n*10)

# consider a situatin in which user wants to print first m multiples
# loop are required to solve such problem
